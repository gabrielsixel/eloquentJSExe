  Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,
  with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the
  number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

  When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for
  numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz"
  for numbers divisible by only one of those).
